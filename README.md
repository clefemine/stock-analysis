# Stock Analysis

Using the VBA button "Run Analysis on All Stocks" you can select which year you would like to analyze. In the analysis you will see each ticker, the daily volume of those tickers and the percentage return (this is highlighted green/red to indicate positive or negative return for a quick visual reference). From running 2018 and 2017 stocks we can visually conclude that 2017 had an overall more positive return percentage for the majority of stocks compared to 2018, which had a greater amount of negative return percentages for the majority of stocks.
